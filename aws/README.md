Please read carefully

Most of our deployment is in github.com/linz/sitelog-manager-aws-deployment

I was using Terraform (0.10.x) to deploy most of the terraform script (for AWS deployment)
For the rest, I was using Cloudformation/Codedeploy/Packer to deploy the infrastructure to Datacom managed account.
